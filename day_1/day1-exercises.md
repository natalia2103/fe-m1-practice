1.  On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
- HTML describes the structure of the pages.

2.  What is the difference between an element and a tag?
- Elements live between angled brackets. They tell the browser something about the information that sits between it's opening and closing tags. The tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.

3.  Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
- Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element.  

4.  Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
- The <title> element shows information about the page at the top of the web browswer (above where you would type in the url) or in the tab for that webpage. The <head> element contains information about the page (rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser window). The contents of the <body> element are shown in the main browser window.

5.  In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
- You can right click and select "view source" or "inspect". "View source" will open a new page with the html code while "view source" will open a window in the window you're browsing for you to look at the code.

6.  List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
  1. <h1></h1> is used for the largest main headings.
  2. <b></b> is used to make a character appear **bold**
  3. <i></i> is used to make a character appear _italic_
  4. <sup></sup> is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power.
  5. <sub></sub> is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with footnotes or chemical formulas.

7.  What are empty elements?
- Empty elements do not have any words between the opening and closing tags. Empty elements usually have only one tag. Before the closing angled bracket of an empty element there will often be a space and a forward slash character.

8.  What is semantic markup?
- A semantic markup is a text element that adds extra information to the pages without affecting the structure of your webpages.

9.  What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.
 1. <abbr></abbr> - is used for abbreviations and acronyms. A title attribute on the opening tag is used to specify the full term. <abbr tittle="Professor">Prof</abbr>
 2. <header> & <footer> - Can be used for the main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site or a header or footer for an individual <article> or <sections> within the page.
 3. <nav></nav> - is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
