**Chapters 13 & 15 Review Questions**

1.  Describe the differences between border, margin, and padding.
- Every box has a border (even if it is not visible) and it separates the edge of one box from another. Margins sit outside the edge of the border. Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it.

2.  For a CSS rule `padding: 1px 2px 5px 10px`, what sides of the content box does each pixel value correspond to?
- from left to right: top, right, bottom, left.

3.  Describe the difference between block-level and inline elements.
- Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text.

4.  What is the role of fixed positioning, and why is z-index important in the scenario of using fixed positioning?
- Fixed positioning positions the element in relation to the browser window, as opposed to the containing element. When you move any element from normal flow, boxes can overlap. The z-index property allows you to control which box appears on top.

5.  What is the difference between a fixed and liquid layout?
- Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels. Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.
