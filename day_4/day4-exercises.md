**Chapter 5 Review Questions**

1.  In an image element, why is the `alt` attribute important?
- The 'alt' attribute provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you can't see it.

2.  What determines if an image element is inline or block?
- Where it is placed. If it's placed before or after a paragraph, it is considered a block element. If it is placed at the beginning or in the middle of a paragraph, it's considered an inline element.

3.  What are the benefits of `jpg` or `png` image file formats?
- Use jpg whenever you have many different colors in a picture. Use png format when saving images with few colors or large areas of the same color.

**Chapter 16 Review Questions**

1.  What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?
- It helps the page to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download.

2.  What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?
- A sprite is when a single image is used for several different parts of an interface. You can add the logo and other interface elements, as well as buttons to the image. The advantage of using sprites is that the web browser only needs to request one image rather than many images, which can make the web page load faster.
