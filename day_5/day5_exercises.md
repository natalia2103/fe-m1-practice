**Chapter 2 Review Questions**

1.  How do you declare a variable. What does the equals sign really mean in JavaScript? What is it called in JavaScript?
- Use the 'var' keyword followed the name of the variable,  the equal sign (assignment operator) and the value (data type) of the variable.

2.  There are three big data types in JavaScript: numbers, strings, and booleans. Describe what each of them are.
- Numeric data types handle numbers. String data types consist of letters and other characters. Boolean data types can have one of two values: true or false.

3.  What are the six rules for naming variables? What are a few JavaScript reserved words that you should avoid using for variable names?
  1. The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign, or an underscore. It must not start with a number.
  2. The name cannot contain a dash or a period.
  3. You cannot use keywords or reserved words. For example: boolean, case, return, and let are all reserved words and keywords.
  4. All variables are case sensitive. It's bad practice to create two variables with the same name using different cases (score vs Score).
  5. Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.
  6. If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word (known as camelCase)

4.  How can an array be useful when dealing with multiple related values? How do you access/change a value in an array?
- Arrays are useful when you don't know how many items a list will contain because, when you create the array, you do not need to specify how many values it will hold. To access a value from an array, after the array name you specify the index number for that value inside the square brackets. You can change the value of an array item by selecting it and assigning it a new value just as you would any other variable.

5.  What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
- An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. A statement is an individual instruction that the computer should follow.

6.  What are three types of operators and how are they used?
* Assignment operators: (=) This says that you are going to assign a value to the variable. It is also used to update the value given to an variable.
* String operators: (+) This is used to join the strings on either side of it.
* Comparison operators: (==, !=, ===, and !===) Are used to evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. The result will be a boolean: true or false.
