**5 Main ingredients of UX (User Experience)**

1. **Phychology** - "What do they expect when they click this
- On the [Starbucks home page](https://www.starbucks.com/?utm_source=google&utm_term=starbucks&utm_campaign=BR+-+Brand+-+High+Volume+-+Desktop+-+Exact&utm_medium=cpc&gclid=CjwKCAiAm-2BBhANEiwAe7eyFOSXi761-8Wrekm2WuuQQvRoO8U62O6c1reGQ3XhDQ2wY9J0YiaijRoCMVcQAvD_BwE) there are examples of getting what you expect when you click on a button, say for instance clicking the 'menu' button will take you to the menu. There is also an example of not getting quite what you expect when you click on 'choose your breakfast'. Even though it does take you to a page where the breakfast options are, the first thing you see is the reserve coffees that are being promoted. You have to scroll down in order to find the breakfast items.

2. **Usability** - "Are you being clear and direct, or is this a little too clever?"
- The [Girrlscout Shop](https://girrlscoutshop.com/) is a small business and even though a lot of the information on their page is direct, the process of signing up for the email description might be a little too clever for some people. Instead of a clear instruction that the box below is to subscribe, the text reads "Let's get intimate".
- The [REI](https://www.rei.com/) website is very clear and direct. I look at the components of the website and I have all the information I need in a very clear format.

3. **Design** - "Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immediately?"
- The [Somewhere That's Green](https://www.somewheregreen.com/) website is beautiful. It has a beautiful color schematic that makes sense with the content of the page.
- The [River's Place](https://www.riversplacebend.com/) website seems cluttered in comparison.

4. **Copywriting** - "Does it reduce anxiety?"
-The [Costco](https://www.costco.com/) website induces my anxiety but I'm not sure it's their fault. There's a lot to buy at Costco and therefore there needs to be a lot of options on their home page.
- The [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) website somehow makes me feel less anxious, even though they have just as much to offer as the Costco website. The homepage doesn't feel as cluttered.

5. **Analysis** - "Do you know why users do that, or are you interpreting their behaviour?"
